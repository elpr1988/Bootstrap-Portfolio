          <p>I was born and raised in South Los Angeles, CA. I have a background in education with an emphasis in 1-on-1 instruction to students with special needs. After 28 years of living in Los Angeles and 10 years of working with students, I decided it was time for a change. I moved across the country to Durham, NC in hopes of a enhacing and embracing a new life and explore the opportinities that come with it.</p>

          <p>I began working at schools as a college-bound tutor. I was asked to return and become a Resource Specialist Para-educator and received ccertification through the Los Angeles Unified School District. In the following years I gained a vast knowledge of learning disabilities within suburban youth. I began as a high school tutor and made my way down to elementary school kids. Being a teacher is a very rewarding career but being an Instructional Assistant was more of my calling. It gave me the ability to support my specific student and I was able to float around the classroom giving children an extra minute or two that they craved.</p>

          <p>It was great to see my students progress throughout the time I spent supporting them. I was able to conduct small group learning, lead the classroom when the teacher was absent, and assist the main office during pupil-free days. I gained a vast knowledge of public school education.</p>

          <p>Although my job was rewarding, my home life wasn't as rewading. That's a story for a blog post. I decided that in order for things to be better and change, that I needed to make it happen. The opportunity arose to move across the country and dare to dream. In the months leading up to the move, I had to dig really deep within myself and remind myself that I deserve all that I want in life. I still have to remind myself and encourage myself to keep swimming and work hard because I want to look back at my life and proudly say "I did that!"</p>
